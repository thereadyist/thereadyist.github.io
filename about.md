Hi, I'm The Readyist. I'm a nerd with a **passion for preparation**; to plan and be ready for the various pitfalls of life. This is where I share my knowledge and experience in the hopes that I can help someone, whether they're in a tough spot or just hoping to avoid one.

I do the planning, so you don't have to! Or at least, hopefully you won't have to do quite as much.

The topics I am primarily focused on are:
* Emergency preparedness
* Home security
* Computer security
* Online privacy
* Money / personal finance
* Self-sufficiency
* Happiness

And the best part is that it's all free! I won't even try to sell you anything! However, where relevant, I may mention products/services that I actually use and/or recommend based on their own merits (and not just to make a referral bonus).

## Why should I trust you?

I may not be a professional in all of these areas, but I'm the next best thing: a nerd!

These are topics that I'm passionate about, and I take a calculated approach to every plan. I'll provide reasoning and evidence for my assertions so that you can do your own research if you want. That way, you don't even have to trust me!

## Disclaimers

**I am not a financial/tax professional or a lawyer.**

I am not liable for any actions you decide to take (or not take) after reading my site. While I may discuss financial/investment/tax/legal topics (generally relating to the U.S.), this does not constitute financial/legal advice. This site is for amusement and learning purposes only. Readers beware: I can even make mistakes sometimes! Generally, I will try to convey my confidence level for the accuracy of statements I make (rather than presenting my train of thought as plain fact), as it changes depending on the topic. For example, I am a software engineer in my day job, so my tech-related assertions are generally going to be reasonable. But I'm not a farmer, so maybe take my gardening advice with a grain of salt. :)
