Hi, I'm The Readyist. I'm a nerd with a **passion for preparation**; to plan and be ready for the various pitfalls of life. I created this site because I put so much research and effort into my own preparedness that I figured I should share it in the hopes that I can help someone, whether they're in a tough spot or just hoping to avoid one.

The topics I am primarily focused on are:
* Emergency preparedness
* Home security
* Computer security
* Online privacy
* Money / personal finance / investing
* Self-sufficiency
* Happiness

And the best part is that it's all free!

## Why should I listen to you?

I may not be a professional in all of these areas, but I'm the next best thing: a nerd! My goal here is to curate and share useful knowledge for the benefit of everyone.

This site is ***NOT*** about:
- Trying to scare you
- Trying to sell you stuff
- Generating ad money from clickbait articles
- Prepping for the zombie apocalypse
- Spreading conspiracy theories
- Spreading any particular political/religious dogma

Am I a "prepper"? Some might say so. But I'm not talking about bunkers and bullets here. I take a sane, **down-to-earth approach** and focus on the things you can *actually do* for the situations that are *actually likely* to happen, so that you can live well no matter what life throws at you.

## Disclaimers

**I am not a financial or legal professional.**

I am not liable for any actions you decide to take (or not take) after reading my site. While I may discuss financial/investment/tax/legal topics (generally relating to the U.S.), this does not constitute financial or legal advice. This site is for amusement and learning purposes only. While I try my best to keep things factual, I cannot guarantee the accuracy of any content.

Also note that while I am not selling anything, I may link to external resources and mention relevant products/services that I actually use and/or recommend based on their own merits (and not just to make a referral bonus).
